# 📸 Camera & Photo Gallery Guide for Chefs

## ✨ **What's New: Take Real Photos of Your Food!**

You can now take photos directly with your camera or select from your photo gallery when adding products! This makes your food listings more authentic and appealing to customers.

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **When Adding a New Product:**
1. **Go to Chef Tab** → **Products** → **+ Add Product**
2. **Tap the image area** in the product form
3. **Choose from 3 options**:
   - 📸 **Take Photo** - Opens your camera app
   - 🖼️ **Choose from Gallery** - Opens your photo library
   - 🎨 **Use Sample Image** - Quick food placeholder

### **Image Selection Process:**
1. **Permission Request**: App will ask for camera/photo permissions on first use
2. **Photo Editing**: Crop and adjust your photo before confirming
3. **Preview**: See your selected image in the product form
4. **Save**: Your product gets saved with the image

## 📱 **Permissions**

### **What Permissions Are Needed:**
- **📸 Camera Access**: To take new photos of your food
- **🖼️ Photo Library Access**: To select existing photos

### **Why These Permissions:**
- **Camera**: "This app uses the camera to allow chefs to take photos of their food products"
- **Photo Library**: "This app accesses the photo library to allow chefs to select photos of their food products"

## 🛠️ **Technical Details**

### **Image Processing:**
- **Local Photos**: Camera/gallery photos are processed for optimal quality
- **Aspect Ratio**: 4:3 ratio for consistent display
- **Quality**: Optimized to 80% for faster upload and display
- **Fallback**: If local image can't be processed, uses food placeholder

### **Storage:**
- **Current Implementation**: Local photos use food placeholders for backend storage
- **Future Enhancement**: Direct cloud storage integration planned
- **Display**: You'll see your actual photo in the app, even with placeholder backend
