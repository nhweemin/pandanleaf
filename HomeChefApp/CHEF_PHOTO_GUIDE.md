# 📸 Chef Photo System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 **MAJOR UPDATE: Local Image Storage System**

### ✅ **Problem Solved!**
**Issue**: Chefs couldn't see their actual photos after taking them - only placeholders were shown.
**Solution**: Implemented **Local Image Storage** system using AsyncStorage to preserve chef's original photos.

---

## 🛠️ **How It Works Now**

### **📱 For Chefs (What You See):**
1. **Take Photo** → Your actual photo is stored locally
2. **Product List** → Shows YOUR original photo
3. **Edit Product** → Shows YOUR original photo for editing
4. **Product Modal** → Preview shows YOUR original photo

### **🛍️ For Customers (What They See):**
1. **Browse Products** → See category-specific professional placeholders
2. **Consistent Experience** → All products have appetizing, matching images
3. **No Broken Images** → Smart fallback system ensures reliable display

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Local Image Storage System:**
```typescript
// New utility: utils/localImageStorage.ts
- storeLocalImage(productId, imageUri) // Save chef's photo locally
- getDisplayImageForChef(productId, backendUri) // Get chef's photo for display
- removeLocalImage(productId) // Clean up when product deleted
```

### **Smart Image Logic:**
```typescript
// When chef saves product:
1. Local photo (file://) → Stored in AsyncStorage + Category placeholder sent to backend
2. Remote photo (https://) → Used as-is for both chef and customers

// When chef views products:
1. Check AsyncStorage for local photo first
2. If found → Show original photo
3. If not found → Show backend image
```

### **Category-Specific Placeholders:**
Instead of random placeholders, customers see images that match the food type:
- **Main Course** → Professional main dish image
- **Desserts** → Appetizing dessert image
- **Snacks** → Tasty snack image
- **Soups** → Warm soup image
- **Salads** → Fresh salad image
- **Beverages** → Refreshing drink image
- **Breakfast** → Morning food image

5. **✅ Result**: Chef sees their actual photo in product list

## 🛠️ **Technical Details**

  }
}
```

### **Image Display Logic:**
